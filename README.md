# Banking-Loan-Repayment-Prediction-Model-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model that determines the chances of a customer(borrower) repaying or defaulting on a loan using ML models. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering to model training, and finally predicting the ouput. 


Objective :

This model is going to help any banking or financial institutions in following ways :

1) Analyse borrower behaviour and repayment patterns
2) Build predictive models for loan repayment classification
3) Identify key financial & demographic influence in repayment

Dataset :

We have two datasets. Dataset 1 is named as ........... Dataset 2 is named as 

Data


Workflow :

1) Data Collection & Cleaning : Handle missing values, duplicates and outliers
